# Introduction
CIBO is a machine learning-based recipe recommendation app that helps users find recipes based on their available ingredients. The app leverages TF-IDF to find the closest recipe matches and is built with Flutter for a seamless and responsive front-end experience.

# Features
#### Ingredient Based Search
CIBO allows users to find recipes based on the ingredients they have on hand. Users can enter a list of ingredients, and the app will leverage a machine learning model, specifically TF-IDF, to identify recipes that closely match the provided ingredients.
#### Recipe Name Search
This feature enables users to search for recipes by name. If a user knows the exact name of the dish they want to prepare, they can simply type it into the search bar. The app will then retrieve recipes that match the name, making it easy for users to find their favorite recipes quickly.
#### Mandatory Ingredients Select
The user has the option to make the selected ingredients mandatory for the dish. The app will then prioritize the mandatory ingredients in its search and recommend only those dishes that have the mandatory ingredient(s)
#### Favorite Dishes
Users can save their favorite recipes for easy access in the future. This feature allows users to build a personal collection of go-to recipes. Favorites are stored locally on the user's device, making  favorite recipes quickly accessible to the user.
